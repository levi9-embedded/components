/*  Connect ultrasonic sensor, two buttons and one LED to Arduino.
 *  On Arduino start, the LED should be turned off. Whenever the ultrasonic 
 *  sensor detects object (like hand wave) it should toggle the state of LED.
 *  Initially the object detection should be as far as possible. Pressing  
 *  one button, the detection distance should decrease by 10 cm, up to a minimum, 
 *  with other button, detection distance should increase by 10 cm, up to a maximum.
