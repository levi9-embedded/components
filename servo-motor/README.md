Servo motor can perform rotation from 0 to 180 degrees.

Pin | Wire | Description
--- | --- | ---
1 | Brown | Connected to ground
2 | Red | Connected to 5v
3 | Orange | Connected to PWM source

Arduino can provide PWM signals on the pins that have symbol ~ next to them. For Arduino Uno these are (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, or 11) pins.

To use servo motor we can use Servo library that is provided with Arduino IDE.
