/* Connect output of PIR sensor to the Arduino analog input.
 * Detection of movement should cause 3.3 volts on the outputs.
 *
 *   Check:
 *     - How reliable detection is
 *     - How far detection works
 *     - Under which light conditions detection works
 *     - How long is output on, after detection event
 *
 * Create app to turn light on for 10 minutes after movement
 * detection is observed, use integrated led on pin 13 as light.
