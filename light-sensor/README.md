Sensor has one digital output that is set when light crosses certain threshold. 

There is a potenciometer on the sensor that is used to adjust the threshold.

TODO: Check that sensor behaves correctly.  
TODO: Make arduino program that would behave as nightlamp
- If light is less then threshold => Turn on light
- If light is more then threshold => Turn off light
- If light is on more then X minutes => Turn off light
